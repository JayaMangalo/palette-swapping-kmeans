# palette-swapping-kmeans
A Matlab program to implement palette swapping with K-Means clustering and basic image processing tools

# Prequisites
Install Matlab with Addon Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox Add-on

# Steps
1. Run GUI (app.mlapp)
2. User provides a base image as input.
3. User may experiment and enter the number of clusters
used by K-Means to segment the image.
4. Program will segment with K-Means, display the
segment image as well as its color palette.
5. User may experiment by selecting a color in the color
palette, as well as selecting a color to transform the
color into.
6. Program will take the target color, output color, and
display an image with the target color from the original
image replaced by the output color.
